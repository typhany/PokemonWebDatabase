## Overview
We intend to build a web database for the original 151 first-generation Pokemon with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web database will be created for the purpose of helping avid fans of Pokemon search and filter specific Pokemon in the database as well as reminisce their childhood with the original Pokemon. They will be able to view statistics and descriptions of their favorite Pokemon or gain more knowledge about a specific Pokemon.
